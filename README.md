## Key Features
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Collect temperature and humidity data using DHT11 sensors.
- **LED Alerts**: Visual alerts (LEDs) for high/low temperature thresholds.
- **Multi-Client Support**: Python server handles multiple ESP8266 clients simultaneously.
- **Cloud Integration**: Data sent to ThingsBoard for dashboard visualization and analytics.
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Customize normal/abnormal temperature ranges on the server.
